# Predicting Song Danceability Models

This project aims to predict the danceability of songs using different models. We utilize a dataset to design and evaluate these models, using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as the evaluation metric to find the best-performing model.

## 資料集

The dataset used contains features of songs and their corresponding danceability scores. These features can include tempo, album type, energy, artist, and more.

## Models

We have designed the following different models for danceability prediction:

#dot SGD regression
SVM
CNN
Random Forest
